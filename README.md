### Implementation

### Dataset
This repository contains a python script and files that list comment IDs.
We provide a script to download a dataset of comments. The script accesses the Guardianâ€™s Web API to download a predefined list of comments identified by their IDs.

The script takes comment IDs as input and retrieves the corresponding comments via the Guardian's API. An API key is required to access the API. You can register for a key by filling out this short form: https://bonobo.capi.gutools.co.uk/register/developer

In case the daily number of API calls is limited, the script stops when the limit is reached. If restarted, the script will continue from the point where it stopped.
